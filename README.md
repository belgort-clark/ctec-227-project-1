# CTEC 227 Spring 2023: Project 1 - Build an Image Gallery with a Registration and Login System

## Project Details

Using the PHP code examples provided in Modules 3 and 4, **build a PHP application** that does the following:

- Allows a user to register and login to your application and use session variables to store user information
- Allows a user to upload images, one at a time only if they are logged in
- Links across the application are provided and work correctly
- Displays the images on the page as a professional looking gallery
- If a user is not logged in they should still be able to see the gallary
- Provides a link below each picture that allows you to delete the image from the gallery. This must only be available to logged in users.
- Style your application to look professional. You must develop this lab to include in your portfolio of work.
- The use of Boostrap is optional. If you know Boostrap you should use it.
- You can use CSS Grid and Flexbox if you want.
- Push your code to GitHub once you have completed the assignment.
- Students will be demoing their projects to the class following the due date.

You can [view a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V_8czWuxM) demonstrating how my lab works. Please ignore the lab number in the video. This lab was originally part of a prior CTEC 127 class. You should also note that mine didn't have the now required registration/login functionality at the time.

## Submission

- Push all of your work including the SQL file for your user table from MySQL. Place this file in a folder named **sql**
- Submit the word "Completed" in Canvas

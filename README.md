# CTEC 227 Spring 2024: Project 1 - Build an Image Gallery with a Registration and Login System

## Project Details

Using the PHP code examples provided in Modules 2 and 3, **build a PHP application** that does the following:

- Allows a user to register and login to your application and use session variables to store user information
- Allows a user to upload images, one at a time only if they are logged in
- Links across the application are provided and work correctly
- Displays the images on the page as a professional looking gallery that you can add to your professional portfolio
- If a user is not logged in they should still be able to see the image gallery. A link to Register and Login are provided.
- Provides a link below each picture that allows you to delete the image from the gallery. This must only be available to logged in users.
- Style your application to look professional. You must develop this lab to include in your portfolio of work.
- The use of Bootstrap is optional but highly recommended. If you know Bootstrap, you should use it. If you care to use another CSS framework such as Tailwind CSS, feel free to use that.
- You can use CSS Grid and Flexbox if you want.
- Push your code to GitHub once you have completed the assignment.
- Students will be demoing their projects to the class following the due date.
- Your project must generate valid HTML, CSS and contain no WAVE Alerts, Color Contrast or Errors.

You can [view a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V_8czWuxM) demonstrating how my lab works. Please ignore the lab number in the video. This lab was originally part of a prior CTEC 127 class. You should also note that mine didn't have the now required registration/login functionality at the time.

## Submission

- Push all of your work including the SQL file for your user table from MySQL. Place this file in a folder named **sql**
- Submit the word "Completed" in Canvas
